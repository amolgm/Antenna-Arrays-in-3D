# Antenna-Arrays-in-3D
Produces radiation pattern for Broadside, Endfire, and Binomial antenna arrays in 3 dimensions

Description	
It is tool to produce radiation pattern for following antenna arrays in 3 dimensions: 
1. Broadside 
2. Endfire 
3. Binomial

Run .m file and enter the no. of elements and distance between elements to produce radiation pattern

Maximizing figure window and using rotate tool might help to analyze radiation pattern in detail

Optimization of code has been done as a matter of practice.

Suggestions are highly encouraged.
